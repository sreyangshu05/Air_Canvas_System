# Air Canvas System

The Air Canvas System is an innovative project that allows users to draw in the air using hand gestures tracked by a webcam. This project utilizes Python along with OpenCV, Numpy, and collections to achieve real-time hand tracking and drawing capabilities.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: The main programming language used for the project.
- **OpenCV**: For video capturing and image processing.
- **Numpy**: For efficient array operations.
- **collections**: For managing the drawing points efficiently.

## Features

- Real-time hand tracking.
- Draw in the air using hand gestures.
- Visualize the drawing on a canvas.

## Usage

1. A window will open showing the webcam feed.
2. Use your index finger to draw on the canvas.
3. Press 'q' to quit the application.
